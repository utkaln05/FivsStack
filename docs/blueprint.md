## Style Guidelines:

- Dark mode as default theme. Analyzing the request, "SaaS", "modern", and "dark theme" point towards professional, technical, sophisticated moods. So we will apply an analogous scheme starting with desaturated purple, and make it dark.
- Primary color: Desaturated purple (#9466FF) to convey a sense of innovation and modernity.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated purple (#1A152E) for a sleek, modern feel.
- Accent color: Cyan (#66FFDA) to provide contrast and highlight interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for a clean, modern, neutral look in headlines and body.
- Minimalist icons to represent services and benefits, aligning with a modern aesthetic.
- Responsive layout for mobile & desktop, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Use subtle animations or transitions (e.g., Framer Motion-style) for hover effects and interactions.
